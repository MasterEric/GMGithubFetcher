# GMGithubFetcher

A simple React Native application to fetch commit data for Github repositories.

Possible ways the app could be improved:

- [ ] Fetch the list of repos a user owns and use them to turn the repo field into a dropdown.
- [ ] Display additional information about the commit, like the author's avatar and the date of the commit.
- [ ] Add additional accessibility features to the app.
- [ ] Add support for additional languages.
